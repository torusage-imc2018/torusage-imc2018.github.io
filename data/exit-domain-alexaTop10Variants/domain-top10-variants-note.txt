This directory contains a list for every unique domain in the Alexa Top 10.

Each list contains domains with the same name, but located under different
top-level domains (usually countries).

Subdomains of the following domains have been removed:
* tmall.com
* github.io
* tumblr.com

But the following domain was kept in the "youtube" list:
* youtube.googleapis.com

We also added the following domains:
* torproject.org based on previous results
* duckduckgo.com because it is the default Tor Browser search engine
